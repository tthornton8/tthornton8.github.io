<h1>Summary</h1>
<div>The temperature variation throughout the insulating tiles on a space shuttle during</div>
<div>re-entry was investigated to recommend a tile thickness for a new spacecraft being</div>
<div>developed. The space shuttle was chosen for the simulation due the similar technology</div>
<div>used.</div>
<div>As it would be unfeasible to solve the heat equation analytically, multiple numeric</div>
<div>methods were used with their stabilities and accuracies investigated. The Crank-Nicolson</div>
<div>method was found to be the most accurate, requiring a time step of 65 seconds for a</div>
<div>spatial step of greater than 0.5mm and is unconditionally stable (this method was used</div>
<div>for the simulation results). The Forward differencing method was found to be the least</div>
<div>accurate, requiring a combination of high spatial step and low time step to remain stable.</div>
<div>For a required maximum inside temperature of 176â—¦C to stop the structure deforming,</div>
<div>the minimum tile thickness was found to be 62mm and occurred at the shuttle wing.</div>
<div>When the spacecraft body and further insulating layers were included in the model, this</div>
<div>was reduced to 15.5mm, Due to the aluminum body acting as a heat sink. This calls</div>
<div>for an accurate thermal model of the entire shuttle-insulator system to be developed.</div>
<div>A GUI was also developed to facilitate ease-of-use of the model and input of additional</div>
<div>materials.</div>
