<p>1. Summary</p>
<p>To aid recycling efforts, a machine was designed to crush plastic flakes into &ldquo;briquettes&rdquo;, ready for storage.</p>
<p>An initial analysis of the problem and concepts of individual subsystems was conducted: for example,</p>
<p>cardboard disks are required to be incorporated into the bottom of each briquette to aid storage. Initial</p>
<p>concepts were critiqued using Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The initial sub-system designs</p>
<p>were: a revolving workstation &lsquo;doughnut&rsquo; shape, a linear production line, and a rail system. The criteria</p>
<p>used in the MCDA ranged from constraints such as the size of the machine to estimated ease of</p>
<p>maintenance.</p>
<p>The briquette size was also considered and the wider of two options was used as it impacted less on the</p>
<p>tight maximum height constraint of 4m. The revolving design was chosen, due to its fast production rate,</p>
<p>with improvements made based on high scoring elements from other concepts. Components were then</p>
<p>selected based on the requirements of the chosen design, which necessitated the use of hydraulics over</p>
<p>pneumatic actuators, for example, due to their reduced speed requirements. Components were then sized</p>
<p>using a mixture of hand calculations and FEA, with safety factors given by Pugsley&rsquo;s method. The &lsquo;DfX&rsquo;</p>
<p>design philosophy was considered at all steps.</p>
<p>A fully functional CAD model of the machine was constructed, allowing the design to be critiqued and</p>
<p>tweaked during the process, as well as providing a basis for technical drawings. A total of 141 different</p>
<p>parts are used in the design, approximately 21% of these were custom parts. A retrospective reliability</p>
<p>assessment was performed to generate a fault tree for the entire system as well as a FMECA table for a</p>
<p>singular subsystem. It was discovered that there was an overreliance on critical components and a</p>
<p>significant lack of redundancy in the system that would have to be incorporated before the machine was put</p>
<p>into market. However, the requirement for an estimated 250,000 briquettes/year was significantly exceeded,</p>
<p>by over 70% &ndash; allowing for a high maintenance time to offset reliability issues.</p>
