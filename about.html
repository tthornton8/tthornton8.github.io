<p style = "margin-left: 3em">A large volume of studentâ€™s has part time jobs, jobs that give them an income but may not help in their development for future careers. Many companies are looking for that next talented graduate that is going to bring a fresh new angle and idea to their organisation. So, why not bring them together in an environment that gives the student a platform to engage in part time work that is relevant to their studies, and supports the development of a career, whilst giving companies access to up and coming enthusiasm, skills and fresh ideas.
    A key element of graduate schemes is to develop the student, and give them real-life experience of working in an organisation. Being a student can be tough, with many needing to work part-time to fund their studies or to have a social life. Not only can this eat into the time required to study, but it may be irrelevant to their course and career aspirations. There are some amazing young students out there, with some fantastic ideas, skills, that could be enhanced and developed throughout their studies, given the right platform, rather than distracted by part-time jobs. 
    <br><br>
    Sites like Kaggle give experts the opportunity to analyse data sets, apply analytical expertise and skills such as machine learning in competition, however companies around the world have a number of projects, both big and small, that could benefit from student research, learning, and fresh knowledge of some exciting new skills and knowledge. So, why not give students the opportunity to work on your projects part time. Why not replace part-time jobs that take them away from their studies, and replace it with part time jobs that enhance and continue to develop them for the future.
    <br><br>
    The aim of the site is to target universities to promote its use in support of continual development of their students, giving them opportunities to obtain an income that expands on graduate placements and their learning. It enables them to put forward new ideas, learn new things from the working world as they go through their university career, that can be reflected back into their studies, and does not distract them from their path and course, in achieving a bright and prosperous career. 
    The site will also provide a platform, whereby employers can upload projects that require fresh innovation and thinking (or just need some enthusiastic support), but also can engage and encourage students throughout their studies, to when they finally come to pick an employer. This process promotes the employer, as well as sets up the student with some valuable experience, as well as develops professional relationships, that will ease the transition from study to career.
    <br><br>
    GradZ is seeking to build and develop the platform, to enable the active engagement of universities in signing up to log all their skills and learning areas, as well as desired companies, to establish a skills platform to promote to prospective employers. Universities already have links to many companies, therefore GradZ is seeking to collaboratively promote the students and their learning to encourage companies to upload projects and tasks that could be completed on a part-time basis by a student with the required skill-set.</p>
