            <h1>Who We Are</h1>
            <p> GradCherry is all about providing the right platform to ensure all those ideas and enthusiasm that students have, are given the right platform and audience, to help them blossom in to their full potential. The next big idea could come at any time, and may just need a few pointers, or some different views from like-minded students, to turn it in to the next big success story. </p>
            <p>GradCherry is designed to be an online community of students that initially specialise in Computer Science; however, the site can open to many fields of study whereby the student is seeking to promote their skills and attract part time & project work. It allows students to build a profile of skills, including any employment experience, which can be added to through opportunities generated via the site. In addition, it is a platform for companies to view the progress of students’ skills and learnings, that may be of interest to a particular project. They may be interested in developing the student further, with employment opportunities to build up their experience and promote the company itself as a desirable workplace for upcoming graduates. </p>

            <h1>How We Started</h1>
            <p>The company was formed through its founder and technical lead, working together as a mentor and student, with a common objective of doing something extra based on mutual enthusiasm, ambition and innovative thinking. Through continued conversations, recognising the talents and skills of the student, ideas and thoughts started to click into place about what could be possible, as well as wanting to support him to develop and harness his learning. Having mentored other computer science students, as well as interviewing a range of graduates for placement opportunities, it was clear to see the high calibre of student being developed by universities, and the potential they have.</p>
            <p>Bouncing ideas off of each other led to an initial concept, combined with the technical skills possessed by the student, to create a first stab at the site. Having taught himself new skills and programming languages to develop the proof of concept, not only had he created a platform for us to launch the business idea, but also added a whole new skillset to his CV. And this is what we want to do, give students the opportunity and work to build up their CV, to add new skills, and experiences, whilst ensuring that what they do throughout university is all relevant to their graduation success and future career.  </p>
